# E06b-Tiles

Excercise for working with the Tiled Map Editor. I've used this program before on a different project, but it was a few years back. It was nice to refamiliarize myself with Tiled (and much easier, as i have more experience now). main1.py allows someone to play as an alien and traverse through a very simple level and pickup some coins.
